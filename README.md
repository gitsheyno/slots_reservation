# üóìÔ∏è Slots Reservation Vue 3 Application

The Solution is focused on the management of reservation slots
management of reservation slots for truckers to pick up and deliver containers at terminals. Your task is to create a web application
that displays and dynamically updates the capacity of time slots for these reservations on incoming events.

## Project Structure

This project consists of several key modules that handle data fetching, real-time updates, UI rendering, and utility logic.

### Application flow

- **Initial Data Fetch**: On app mount, the app fetches time slot data from the `/timeSlots` REST endpoint.
- **Data Adapter**: Slot data is enriched with mock fields like `instructor` and `location` grouped by date and time.
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: The app listens to the `/sse` endpoint for real-time updates (capacity and category changes).
- **Toast Notification Service**: A custom notification system alerts the user of live slot updates.
- **Search and Filter**: Users can filter slots by instructor, location, category, and limit results.
- **Dynamic UI Rendering**: The slot list is grouped by date and time and visually styled based on `category` (green, yellow, red).

## Requirements Implemented

‚úÖ Initial data is fetched from the `/timeSlots` endpoint  
‚úÖ Real-time updates handled via SSE from the `/sse` endpoint  
‚úÖ Capacity and category updates are applied live  
‚úÖ Visual display of start time, end time, current / max capacity, and category  
‚úÖ Grouping of time slots by date and time  
‚úÖ Dynamic color styling (green, yellow, red)  
‚úÖ Toast notifications show update events  
‚úÖ Search and filter by instructor, location, and category  
‚úÖ Unit tests for important functionality  
‚úÖ Code written in TypeScript using Vue 3 Composition API

### Installation

To get the project running locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gitsheyno/slots_reservation.git
cd slots_reservation
npm install
npm run dev
npm run test
```

## TechStack

- Vue3 and complete composition API
- Typescript
- as CSS library I have used Tailwind CSS
- as State management, Global state i have used Pinia for Toaser and for components local States like ref
- date-fs for formating date
- Vitest

## design choices

- I have implemented multiple layer components to seperate the concerns like presentation layer, API layer, application layer, reusabiliy

- abstracted out the fetch logic in a compsoable and dident use tools like tanstack query since it was just about inital load and only fetch API was enough.

- i have used adaptor layer first to add additional data to Slots like instructor and location, then i have grouped slots base don date and time.
- to handle fetched data i used local states, since using props in this case was enough and using global state was not requiered.
- abstracted out connection to server to get the real time updates using EventSource.
- i havent use any UI-library and tried to show my skills creating UI and used Tailwind to style.
- For real-time updates, I followed a pattern of centralized data updates:
  ‚Ä¢ The parent component holds and manages the grouped data.
  ‚Ä¢ On receiving an SSE event, the parent updates the corresponding slot item directly.
  ‚Ä¢ The v-for loop then automatically re-renders the updated data.
- I have implemented Toaster using Pinia state management to send notification for each update
- For a better user experience, I added search, filtering, and limiting capabilities:
  ‚Ä¢ Users can filter by instructor, location, or category.
  ‚Ä¢ Custom input fields and dropdown components were created without external libraries.
- For statefull logics like fetching data and handling SSE i have used composable.
- I have kept all adaptor and helper functions in utility file
